# Esopoly
Polyglot written in 7 esoteric programming languages: [Malbolge](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge), [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), [Whitespace](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace), [Spoon](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Spoon), [asdf](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Asdf), [123](http://esolangs.org/wiki/123) and [EXCON](http://esolangs.org/wiki/EXCON). It pretends to be a program in the language whose interpreter is working now :)

If you want to know how it was impemented please read wiki: [en](https://github.com/kenrube/Esopoly/wiki/Process-of-creation), [ru](https://github.com/kenrube/Esopoly/wiki/Процесс-создания). [This link](https://github.com/kenrube/Esopoly/blob/master/source?ts=1) shows appropriate source view. How it should look in fact:
